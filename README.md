# bit-docs

Loosely based on ideas and lessons learned from [DocumentJS](http://documentjs.com), bit-docs is an evolving set of tools that allow you to:

 - Write documentation inline or in markdown files.
 - Specify your code's behavior precisely with JSDoc
   and [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler)
   annotations.
 - Generate multi-version documentation websites for your code from the inline and markdown documentation.
 - Customize the theme and lay out the generated website.
